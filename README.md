## 📖 Overview (Paper Abstruct)
This paper introduces a Tetun text corpus Lafaek-Corpus1M+. A Large Language Model (LLM) has attracted full
attention in natural language processing and speech processing. To build an LLM, huge corpora are basically needed,
however, it is quite hard for low-resourced languages. We focus on one Asian language Tetun, and make a text corpus for
a Tetun LLM. We collect more than million Tetun sentences from various resources. After that, we applied continual pretraining to a Llama-3.1 model using our corpus to build a
Tetun LLM. We conducted machine translation experiments. It is found that our LLM achieved better performance than the original model, and the effectiveness of our corpus is clarified.
